This file includes results for 48 participants:
    argument: identifier of an argument (1 through 40). Each argument is a triple [premise_1, premise_2, conclusion])
    participant: participant identifier (1 through 48)
    rating: participant's rating on a scale from 1 to 7
    condition: both_premises corresponds to Experiment 1 in the paper. premise_1 (ie a one-premise argument with premise_1 as the premise) and premise_2 (one-premise argument with premise_2 as the premise) are reported as Experiment 2 in the paper.
    edge_qn: is the argument an edge case? (see p 6 of paper for definition)
    conflict_qn: is the argument a conflict case?
